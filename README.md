# [Python-Alien-Invasion-Game-Release][url]
<br>·A pygame Alien Invasion case with tkinter GUI initialization window.
<br>·Inspired and Instructed by [Eric Matthes][ehmatthes]'s [Python Crash Course][book].
<br>·Major improvement are as follows:
<br> -Animated alien figures.
<br> -Saving highest score via .json file before shutting down the game.
<br> -Introducing sound effects as shots fired, enemies eliminated, level up, crashes or failures. Main title bgm will be muted as game starts.
<br> -A simple GUI window that will initialize gaming configuration as well as save current configuration every time when game starts.

# For source codes and compilation: 
<br>Run options.py to open GUI initialization window. Python run setup.py as build (python setup.py build) to compile source codes into executable program (cx_Freeze package NEEDED!). After compilation, please move 'fonts', 'sounds' and  'images' folders next to the .exe program to run the game normally (all other attached source files could be deleted then).
